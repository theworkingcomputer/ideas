An idea for a basic site/blog/app builder using a PyQt frontend and pelican for most of the actual lifting. Not sure if it will work for more than building a static website. But I am sure it will do that, and do it well across multiple platforms. May be my next big thing, may be a good android project as well, using p4a.
